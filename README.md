## Who am I?
I'm a student of National Research University of Electronic Technology, studying Computer Science and Engineering. Here in my GitHub are mostly examples of what I did when I was in high school, when as a student I don't have time to do it all.
## What will I place here?
Idk. I hope to continue doing fun stuff when I finally get some spare time, but it will probably be C/C++ and Verilog projects, since that's what I'm studying at university.
